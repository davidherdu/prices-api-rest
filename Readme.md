# üëã About

Prices API Rest project based on layered architecture.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

- JDK 11.
- Maven 3.8.4

## üìò Technologies

### Common

I've built this project following a typical layered architecture (controller, service and repository). I've added a `GlobalExceptionHandler` to manage exceptions and possible errors within the API

### H2 adapter

| Technology | Purpose |
| ---------- |----------|
| [H2Database](https://www.h2database.com/html/main.html) | Very fast, open source, JDBC API. Support embedded and server modes; disk-based or in-memory databases |
| [Spring Data JPA](https://spring.io/projects/spring-data-jpa) | JPA based repositories implementation |
| [Flyway](https://flywaydb.org/) | To load database migrations at application startup. |

### REST adapter

| Technology | Purpose |
| ---------- |----------|
| [springdoc-openapi-ui](https://springdoc.org/) | Helps to automate the generation of API documentation using spring boot projects. |
| [rest-assured](https://rest-assured.io/) | Testing and validating REST services |

## üöÄ How to execute the application

Go to the project root directory and execute the following command to compile, test, package and install the different artifacts in your local maven repository.

```shell
mvn clean install
```

Or use the embedded maven wrapper if you don't have a maven installation.

```shell
./mvnw clean install
```

After creating all artifacts you can run the project with the following command:

```shell
mvn spring-boot:run
```

Or use the embedded maven wrapper if you don't have a maven installation.

```shell
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

It means the application is running properly and it will provide the following endpoints:

- `http://localhost:8080/api/prices`. GET http method that will receive three parameters.
- `http://localhost:8080/v3/api-docs`. OpenAPI schema auto-generated from the swagger annotation provided by the `springdoc` dependency.
- `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html`. Swagger interface based on the OpenAPI auto-generated schema that helps you to test the `prices` resource endpoint.
